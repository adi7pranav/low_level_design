# 📘 Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns — Quick Reference

The **23 GoF Design Patterns** were introduced in the book:

> *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*  
> by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (1994)

These patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in object-oriented software.

## ✅ What they are

GoF patterns are **design templates** — not code snippets — that help you build systems that are:

- Loosely coupled
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to extend
- More testable

They are grouped into **three categories** based on their purpose.

# 🔹 1. CREATIONAL PATTERNS (5)

> Concerned with **how objects are created**

1. **Singleton**  
   Ensures a class has only one instance.

2. **Factory Method**  
   Lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

3. **Abstract Factory**  
   Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.

4. **Builder**  
   Constructs complex objects step-by-step.

5. **Prototype**  
   Creates new objects by cloning existing ones.

# 🔹 2. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS (7)

> Concerned with **how classes and objects are composed**

6. **Adapter**  
   Makes incompatible interfaces work together.

7. **Bridge**  
   Separates abstraction from implementation.

8. **Composite**  
   Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

9. **Decorator**  
   Dynamically adds behavior to objects.

10. **Facade**  
    Provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

11. **Flyweight**  
    Shares objects to reduce memory usage.

12. **Proxy**  
    Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object.

# 🔹 3. BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS (11)

> Concerned with **how objects interact and communicate**

13. **Strategy**  
    Defines interchangeable algorithms.

14. **Observer**  
    Defines a publish–subscribe relationship.

15. **Command**  
    Encapsulates a request as an object.

16. **State**  
    Allows an object to change behavior based on state.

17. **Template Method**  
    Defines the skeleton of an algorithm.

18. **Mediator**  
    Reduces coupling between communicating objects.

19. **Chain of Responsibility**  
    Passes requests along a chain of handlers.

20. **Visitor**  
    Separates operations from object structure.

21. **Memento**  
    Captures and restores object state.

22. **Iterator**  
    Provides a way to traverse a collection.

23. **Interpreter**  
    Defines a grammar and interpreter for a language.
